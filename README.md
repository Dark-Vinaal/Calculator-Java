# 🧮 Java Swing Calculator

A modern, fully functional **GUI Calculator** built using **Java Swing**.  
This project demonstrates event-driven programming, GUI layout design, and arithmetic logic implementation in Java — combining functionality with a clean digital aesthetic.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Java Swing Calculator** is a desktop-based application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation.  
It features a responsive interface inspired by physical calculators, using digital-style fonts and a dark theme for better visual clarity.

This project is ideal for beginners learning **Java GUI (Swing)** or for anyone wanting to understand **event handling** and **component-based design** in a real-world example.

## 🧰 Key Features

- 🎨 **Modern UI Design** – Black-themed digital display with green calculator-style digits  
- ⚙️ **Arithmetic Operations** – Supports `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`, `%`, and exponentiation (`^`)  
- 🔢 **Functional Buttons** – Includes `CL`, `DEL`, and `.` for clear, delete, and decimals  
- 💡 **Interactive Event Handling** – Built entirely using `ActionListener`  
- 🧮 **Accurate Calculations** – Real-time input and output for user interaction  
- 🪟 **Built with Java Swing** – Demonstrates frame creation, layout control, and button interactivity
